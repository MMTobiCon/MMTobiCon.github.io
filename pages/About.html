      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>We started JSL out of frustration of the numerous existing javascript resources out there, but there seems to be no way of finding that proper guide, that straight line that would lead me to my dream job, we decided it would be beter if everyone can get personlized training what could happen to the tech ecosystem and human resource as a result, that is why we decided to launch this program and create superstar coders that beats every self taught programmer out there!</p>
